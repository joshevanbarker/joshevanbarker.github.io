I am a Financial Statistics Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Previously at the Philadelphia Fed, I began on the Government Relations team and then moved to Economic Research. While in college, I interned at the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the American Enterprise Institute.  

I received my B.A. in Economics and Politics from Hillsdale College in 2023 and my M.S. in Data Science from Eastern University in 2025. 

My key areas of academic interest include Public Finance, International Trade, Public Choice, Political and Economic Philosophy, and Machine Learning methods in Economic Research.
