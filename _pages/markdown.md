I am current a Financial Statistics Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Previously at the Philadelphia Fed, I have worked in both Government Relations and Economic Research. I have also interned at the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the American Enterprise Institute.

I received my B.A. in Economics and Politics from Hillsdale College in 2023 and my M.S. in Data Science from Eastern University in 2025.
