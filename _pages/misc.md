### Transportation
Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by road maps and transportation improvement projects. Over the years, I've invented various highway proposals of my own. I have also taken digitized highway proposals from the past and made them more accessible. Below is a project I completed mapping Atlanta's Urban Area Tollway Plan from the early 1970s--the details of which can be found in the <a href= "https://digitalcollections.library.gsu.edu/digital/collection/PlanATL"> Georgia State University archives</a>--into the present-day Google Maps. The proposal was quelched by oppositions by the upper-middle-class neighborhoods that would be impacted. The already acquired land became Freedom Parkway (itself delayed more than a decade of additional protests), the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library, and a handful of parks and greenways. However, the idea briefly resurfaced in the late aughts and early 2010s with a <a href= "https://web.archive.org/web/20111003191506/http://americandreamcoalition.org/highways/ps351.pdf#page=29">report</a> sponsored by the Reason Foundation and Georgia Public Policy Foundation identifying that this roadway capacity was desperately needed. Take a look for yourself at what could have been in the map below.
