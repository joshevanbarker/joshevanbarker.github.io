### <a href="/portfolio/call_report_rshiny">Call Report SQL Database and R Shiny Application
Languages: SQL and R<br>
I created a user application to make publicly available Call Report Data (financial statements from banks and financial institutions) more easily accessible. I created a SQL database to store the data and staged it in different tables. Then, I built an R Shiny Application allowing users to easily query, graph, and analyze the data.

### <a href="/portfolio/exports">Exports Forecasting</a>
Languages: Python and HTML<br>
I imported and cleaned data from over a dozen sources. Then, I modeled export volumes by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) using several different models. Finally, I created a Flask App user-interface to allow users to interact with the models and estimate export volumes for different MSAs.
